
Three types of convergence informations (Time, residual error, relative error, no of iterations are the number of rows of each data- 1000,000)

Dataset Info: four types of datasets:

1. random Gaussian
2. random highly correlated
3. LibSVM collection
4. Netlib LP collection
5. Matrix Market Sparse Data


*** CPU Time vs Sample size:

Use the "CPU time vs sample size.m" file for time vs beta data genration for the test instances.

*** CPU Time vs Delta:

Use the "CPU time vs delta.m" file for time vs delta data genration for the test instances.



*** Residual, FSC vs Time & No. of Iterations:

Use the "res_FSC_DC.m" file for the decay data generation for the test instances by varying beta, delta.
